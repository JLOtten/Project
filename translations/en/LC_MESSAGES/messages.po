msgid "Learning to code"
msgstr ""
"Learning to code is hard, especially if you run into a lot of negative "
"reinforcement along the way. People from underrepresented backgrounds "
"will likely run into more negative reinforcement as they work to break "
"into tech. Current statistics in tech careers for women, people of color "
"or LBGTQ communities show a stark dissonance compared to the demographics"
" of the general population."

msgid "Computer Science students"
msgstr ""
"Computer Science students in universities across the United States do not"
" represent the demographics of our country. There are many reasons for "
"this underrepresentation of diversity in tech careers: from lack of early"
" exposure, repeated discouragement or lack of access to quality STEM "
"education to name a few."

"Coder’s Boost is designed to reassure you that you belong in this field "
"and give you positive reinforcement to encourage you on your journey. "
"Motivation is highly tied to educational outcomes. Learning to code is a "
"long and sometimes arduous process, especially if you are doing so "
"remotely. Coder’s Boost is here to help emerging coders keep their "
"motivation from waning–one boost at a time. Why? Because tech needs you. "
"Your perspective is valuable. You can help so many people like you "
"through your representation and hard work. You belong here."
